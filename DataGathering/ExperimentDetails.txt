Subjects:
    -Subject 1: Male, 25 years old, right-handed, no prior BCI experience.
        -Subject had often consumed caffeine within 1-2 hours prior to recording.
        -Subject reported difficulty in maintaining focus on stimuli during imagined activity. Additionally, subject
        reported difficulty in effectively imagining movement consistently and without accidentally focusing on other
        bodily movements.
            -This has lead to the avoidance of imagined stimuli for further test due to excessive waste in time with
            failed recordings.
            -This could also be due to the subject's old diagnosis of ADHD causing difficulties in focus.

        -Subject reported eye-strain and focus issues after 3 concurrent recording sessions (240s per session).
    -Subject 2: Male, 22 years old?, right handed?, no prior BCI experience.
        -Slightly thicker hair may result in worse signal quality.
        -Managed to avoid blinks during stim times for the most part.
        -Mentioned that it was difficult to remain comfortable without conscious movement between stimuli.
        -In observed recordings, clear fluctuations were present for hf stim, but not lr stim.
        -Centre-head electrod placement meant no observed eyeblinks.
        -Subject did not report any strong eye-strain from focus.
        -Subject did report difficulty in maintaining focus on stim window over other on-screen elements.
        -Subject had not consumed caffeine or other stimulants in the morning prior to recording.
    -Subject 3: Male, 25 years old, right handed, no prior BCI Experience.
        -Avoided blinking during stim.
        -Did not focus entirely on the grid, eyes roamed, but kept grid in peripheral to see stimulus.
        -Mentioned that he felt like he was anticipating the stimulus.
        -Did not report strong eye-strain.
        -Had consumed caffeine prior to recording.
    -Subject 4: Male, 42 years old, left handed, prior BCI experience.
        -Had consumed caffeine prior to recording.
    -Subject 5: Male, 56 years old, right handed, no prior BCI experience.
        -Had consumed caffeine prior to recording.
        -Reported no issues with eye fatigue.


Subject Instructions:
    Each subject was instructed to remain relaxed until stimulus onset.
    Upon stimulus onset, subjects were instructed to engage the specified activity, be it motor movement or imagery,
    in accordance with the details below. Subjects were instructed to maintain said activity for the duration of the
    stimulus being displayed and to then relax upon the stimulus being cleared.
    Subjects were instructed to avoid blinking during motor imagery or activity, but allowed such action during rest
    periods.

Experimental Setup:
    -Location: Flinders University Tonsley Campus, Room 4.53
    -Hardware: OpenBCI Ganglion Board (4-Channels), OpenBCI EEG Headband Kit (2 Flat-Snape Dry Electrodes, 2 Comb Dry
    electrodes), Lenovo Thinkpad Pro 580 Laptop (Recording Device).
    -Electrode Locations: Fp1, Fp2, O1, O2 (Standard Configuration) C3, C4, Cz (Optimal Configuration)
        Note: Electrode locations are a rough estimate. The OpenBCI EEG Headband is not exact with electrode placement
        even when used in the intended manner (i.e. as a headband), and when strapped under the chin for motor cortex
        placement, the electrodes are noticeably forward compared to 10-20 system diagrams.

Methodology:
    Subjects were presented with stimuli representing a particular direction, and instructed to to either perform the
    following action or imagine the following action based on the data required.
        Left Arrow - Open/Close left hand
        Right Arrow - Open/Close right hand
        Up Arrow - Open/Close both hands
        Down Arrow - Move both feet in a circular motion.
    The stimuli were shown for a total of 4 seconds each, in a randomised order, with a six second break between each
    stimuli being shown.

Data Format:
    Experimental data is saved as the standard output of the MNE raw.save() method, in the .fif file format.
    Channels are named appropriately, and stimulation markers are present in the channel STI001, with a value of 1
    being representing the onset of rest, 2 representing the onset of left/up arrows and 3 representing onset of
    right/down arrows.
    This data is able to be read directly using the MNE raw.load() function, but other programs may not be capable.
